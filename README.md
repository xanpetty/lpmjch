# Example code from Learning PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS & HTML5 by Robin Nixon, 3rd edition

The book's website is here if you want the actual code: http://lpmj.net/3rdedition/

This repository is just a chance for me to practice using GitHub while I refresh my memory. 
My examples are not perfect replications of the book's code examples and 
I skip some examples that are pointless to type out like demonstrations of bad code practices.

I've used a gitignore file so that login.php is not added to the repo.
Instructions for creating login.php are on pg. 234 of the 4th edition.
